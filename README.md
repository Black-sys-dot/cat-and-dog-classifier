Paws vs Claws: The Ultimate Cat-Dog Classifier 🐾🐶🐱<br><br>

What Even Is This?
<br>
<br>
<!-- Add funny intro about what the project does -->Features (aka What This Bad Boy Can Do):
<br>
This can do many things, like:
<br>
Classifying cats.
<br>
Classifying dogs.
<br>
And, wait for it… classifying both cats and dogs.
<br>
<br>
Cool, right? 😎 I know, I’m smart as f**.
<br>
How to Run This Thing (Usage):
<br>
You can run this in Kaggle. Just add the cat-dog dataset, you dumbass.
<br>
Is it Cool? 😎:
<br>
I’d say it’s okay. It’s trained on like 500 examples, I think, because I built it many days ago, and now I’m writing this README. I know, right? Super hardworking.
So, as the hardworking person I am, I tested it on like 4 examples from the training set (I guess). Pretty sure I didn’t test it on the test set though, but who knows? 🤷‍♂️ So yeah, that’s where we’re at. Go figure.

License (The Boring but Important Stuff):

If you want to use this sht algorithm, you can. Just don’t blame me if it f**s up or somehow crashes your kernel or messes with you from behind (if this happens, just say "choke me daddy").
